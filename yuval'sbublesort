def basicsort(arr):
      n = len(arr)   # n is the length of the array
      for i in range(n-1):  # for loop start, runs an index in range of the length minus 1 (real size)
              for j in range(n - 1 - i):  # start of second for loop - j is a new index that allows us to index the array in it's sorted form. after the first run, the largest number should end up on the furthest corner -  as such you dont need to count him again - so instead of using i ( the og index) you should have new one in a new loop whos range would be n - 1 - i (therfore eliminating the largest already sorted number.)   
                if arr[j] > arr[j+1]: # if a spot is bigger then the one that follows
                    temp = arr[j] # temporery veriable stores current index value
                    arr[j] = arr[j+1] # next index becomes the next smaller index
                    arr[j+1] = temp  #next index is bigger previus index
